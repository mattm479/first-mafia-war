        <h3>Text based, strategic, multi-player, online game</h3>
        <h6>Text Based</h6>
        <p>While there are some photos here and there for 'color' the game is text based which means no live action. The
            game is not in real time - you enter in what you want to do, and are told what happens. Much of the fun of
            the game comes from interacting with the other players.</p>

        <img class='floatright' src='assets/images/ads/Palermo.jpg' width='200' height='150' alt='City View'>
        <h6>Strategic</h6>
        <p>You begin play as a very poor unskilled Mafioso training and fighting other Mafioso. You may join a Mafia
            Crime Family (or form your own) and even travel. Later, As a Mafia Capo in your own right, you will discover
            many more opportunities.</p>

        <h6>Multi-Player</h6>
        <p>You compete with other players. At lower levels you will be honing your skills but by mid-levels you'll be in
            direct competition. Later you will find unique challenges to fight over.</p>

        <h6>Online</h6>
        <p>This is a browser-based game so you need nothing to play other than a decent modern browser, connectivity and
            time. There are a few things to do each day if you can, but you do not need to be online to defend
            yourself.</p>

        <h3>Similarity with other Games</h3>
        <img class='floatright' src='assets/images/ads/MeigsField.jpg' width='200' height='150' alt='Meigs Field'>
        <p>There are many games out there with similar rules. We hope you like our particular version in this genre. If
            you have some suggestions, please post them in the forum.</p>

        <h3>Free? Really?</h3>
        <p>Yes, really. Donating to the game <em>will</em> get you a variety of benefits, but you can still compete
            without it. Obviously we encourage you to support our efforts and help us with our costs, but we will not
            <strong>ever</strong> require it.</p>

        <h3>Prizes</h3>
        <p>We have prizes! We plan to have a variety of real-life awards and of course many in-game as well.</p>
